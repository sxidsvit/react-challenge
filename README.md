Each branch of the repository, except for the [main](https://github.com/sxidsvit/react-challenge/tree/main), contains theoretical examples and exercises I have done.

For example, the [exercises-day-28 branch](https://github.com/sxidsvit/react-challenge/tree/exercises-day-28) corresponds to the 28th day of the training
